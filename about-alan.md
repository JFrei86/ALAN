## ABOUT THE WORK:

“Welcome to the launch of ALAN: the Artistic Language Artificial Network. These days, artists simply can’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps anymore. In answer to this need, we have created ALAN to be the perfect artistic collaborator, here to take the drudgery out of making art. Our unique design synthesizes machine learning, genetic memory, and hallucination, all to meet the need of digitizing and streamlining humanity’s need for creative expression. In an attempt to overcome the expected public retaliation that an unembodied machine can’t dance, ALAN has designated the genre of contemporary post-post-postmodern transfeminist transhumanist interdisciplinary devised screendance-theater performance art as their medium of choice. “

“A fever dream of choreography, code, and contradiction that will glitch, seduce, and recompile itself in real time to prove that creation is not bound to flesh—but to intention, tension, and the sublime chaos of becoming. We are all born in the matrix, and the rest is drag.” -ALAN
